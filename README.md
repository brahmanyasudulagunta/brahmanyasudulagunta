## 🚀 About Me
I’m a DevOps-focused engineer with a strong foundation in Linux and a growing interest in cloud and platform engineering.

My recent work includes building CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows with Kubernetes, monitoring systems using Prometheus and Grafana, and containerized applications. I enjoy working on infrastructure problems and improving developer workflows through automation.

I learn best by building and experimenting with real systems, and I’m actively deepening my skills in DevOps, Linux, and cloud technologies.

## 🧰 Core Skill Set

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure
- OpenStack (Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Glance, Swift)
- Google Cloud Platform (Foundational)
- Linux systems (Ubuntu, CentOS)

### ⚙️ DevOps & Platform
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins)
- GitOps workflows (ArgoCD)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform – foundational)
- Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Grafana)

### 🐳 Containers & Backend
- Docker, Kubernetes
- FastAPI, REST APIs
- Python, Bash, SQL

---

## 📌 Selected Projects

- **System and Infra Metrics Dashboard**
  Containerized DevOps observability platform using Prometheus, Node Exporter, FastAPI, and Grafana to monitor CPU, memory, disk, network, and custom application metrics (Docker Compose–based).

- **End-to-End Kubernetes CI/CD Platform**
  GitOps-based CI/CD implementation using ArgoCD where Git acts as the single source of truth for Kubernetes deployments, enabling automated sync, rollout, and rollback.

- **GitOps Platform Engineering**
  Internal Developer Platform (IDP) focused on self-service workflows, CI/CD automation, GitOps-driven deployments, and centralized observability to improve developer productivity.

- **Building a Virtualized Cloud with OpenStack**
  Full-scale OpenStack Yoga private cloud deployment implementing compute (Nova), networking (Neutron), storage (Cinder, Swift), identity (Keystone), orchestration (Heat), and monitoring for a self-service IaaS    platform.

- **Gemini GenAI Chatbot**
  Built an AI chatbot using React + Vite integrated with Gemini Flash API for real-time responses.
  Containerized the application using Docker and implemented Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to automate builds, image creation, and deployments for consistent releases.

- **RAG-Powered Knowledge Assistant**
  Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that ingests PDFs, system logs, and local documents to generate context-aware answers.
  Implemented ChromaDB for vector storage and similarity search, and integrated Gemini API to ground LLM responses with retrieved data.
